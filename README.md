 ## Alarm Clock using Node.js
This is a simple script that uses Node.js to set an alarm clock that plays a wav file at a specific time every day.

 ## Requirements
 Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js)
 A wav/mp3 file named alarm.wav/mp3 in the same directory as the script

 ## Installation
 Install the required npm packages by running  ## npm install node-schedule and npm install child_process in the command line.
Create an MP3 file named alarm.mp3 in the same directory as the script.
  ## Usage
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script by typing node alarm.js and press enter.
The script will set the alarm for 5 AM and will log the message "Setting alarm for 5:00 AM..." to the console.
The alarm will play alarm.mp3 at 5:00 AM every day and will log the message "Wake up! It is 5:00 AM."
This script uses the node-schedule library to schedule a job that will execute the command afplay alarm.wav/mp3 (which plays an MP3 file on macOS) at 5:00 AM every day. The child_process library is also used to execute the command.

 ## Note 
You can customize the alarm time by modifying the rule.hour and rule.minute values in the script.
